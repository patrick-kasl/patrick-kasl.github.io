# Browserify and Github pages are a match made in heaven

The incredible thing is, we can take a project that works in node.js and get it to run as a static website in our own personal webpage.

I've also started to explore Pyodide as I primarily work in Python day-to-day. It would be nice to be able to add components to my website built in Python. Unfortunately, Pyodide is quite slow. It seems like this is primarily due to initialization time.
